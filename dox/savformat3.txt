Unless otherwise stated, values are stored as 4 byte Little-Endian Integers
When you see a { } it means that the number of bytes of the value inside is determined by the value of the outside.
Unless otherwise stated, numbers are in *Decimal* format.
? Represents a 4-byte longint with an unknown value.
A number (such as 540 or 440) appear as-is in the file (as a longint).
The purpose of these bytes are essentially unknown.
k8: this is shitmaker version which introduced data structure with this format.
Most words (like game_id and hspeed) will be actual variables stored,
unless they begin with a capitol letter, like X or Hspeed, in which case
GM keeps track of the value without a variable.
